## Why Ronins React?

The JavaScript ecosystem moves fast. **Too fast.**

Every week brings new frameworks, new bundlers, new tools. AI is making this even faster. But you just want to build your app.

**The reality:**

- npm has **3+ million packages** — most are old or not safe
- **React is still #1** — 40% of developers use it, 11 million websites
- Choosing the right tools takes **days of research**

### We Did the Research

Ronins React is not just a template. It is **opinionated curation**.

We tested many tools and picked the best ones:

| What You Need | What We Chose | Why |
|--------------|---------------|-----|
| Build Tool | Vite 7 + SWC | Fastest dev server, instant HMR |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 4 | Industry standard, zero runtime |
| Components | shadcn/ui | Own your code, not a dependency |
| Routing | React Router 7 | Most popular, React team endorsed |
| Server State | TanStack Query 5 | Best caching and sync |
| Validation | Zod 4 | TypeScript-first, runtime safe |
| Code Quality | ESLint 9 + Prettier | Clean, error-free code |

### Why Not Other Options?

| Option | Problem |
|--------|---------|
| `npm create vite` | Only gives Vite + React. You add everything else. Takes hours. |
| Next.js | Too complex for simple apps. Server Components, App Router... |
| TanStack Start | Too new. Still in beta. Not stable. |
| Create React App | Dead project. No updates. Very slow. |

### Zero Decision Fatigue

::: code-group

```bash [npm]
npm create ronins-react@latest my-app
cd my-app && npm install && npm run dev
```

```bash [bun]
bun create ronins-react@latest my-app
cd my-app && bun install && bun dev
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm create ronins-react@latest my-app
cd my-app && pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn create ronins-react@latest my-app
cd my-app && yarn && yarn dev
```

That's it. No configuration. No research. Just code.

**React powers the web. We power your React setup.**
